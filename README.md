# Oddworld Stranger's Wrath HD Autosplitter
Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD Autosplitter v2.2

This autosplitter works for both Any%, Any% No Ghost, All Bounties and Individual Levels.
Do keep in mind that this autosplitter has been made based on the current routes we use (on the 18.03.2021),
so any major change in the routes might resulte in the autosplitter not working anymore.
If it's the case or you're having issues with the autosplitter, you can contact me on discord (Fxyz#1329) and i'll figure a way to fix it.

Splits files for every Full Game categories and Individual Levels can be found on speedrun.com resources tab.

This autosplitter has a built in load time remover, for it to work right click on your liveSplit window, select "Compare Against", then select "game time"


!!! BEFORE STARTING THE GAME, BE SURE TO HAVE CORRECTLY SELECTED THE PLATFORM ON WHICH YOU'RE RUNNING THE GAME IN THE SETTINGS OF THE AUTOSPLITTER (Steam or GOG) !!!
