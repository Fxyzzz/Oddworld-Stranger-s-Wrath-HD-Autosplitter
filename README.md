The autosplitter works for every full game categories and Individual Levels.
Do keep in mind that this autosplitter has been made based on the current routes we use (on the 15.05.2022),
so any major change in the routes might resulte in the autosplitter not working anymore.
If it's the case or you're having issues with the autosplitter, you can contact me on discord (Fxyz#1329) and i'll figure a way to fix it.


Where to find the autosplitter and splitfiles?

	- The autosplitter is found directly in LiveSplit in the "Edit Splits" tab.
	- Splits files for the autosplitter can be foundin the resources tab on speedrun.com


Now There are four settings you can set:

1. Full Game Categories : In this one select the category you are running (Uncheck this tab if you're running Individual Levels !!!)

	!!! You will need to tick Both the category and the restriction of your run for the autosplitter to work !!!

2. Individual Levels: 2 tabs in here:

	2.1. Splitting options: Select between 2 splitting methodes for IL (select only one !!!):
		2.1.1. Single split: only one split at the end of the level
		2.1.2. Multiple splits: adds some extra splits (when there are some, you can leave this checked even if the current level has only 1 split at the end)
	
	2.2. Levels: Select which level you're running (select only one !!!)

(uncheck the Individual levels tab if you're running a Full Game Category !!!)

3. Refresh rate of the autosplitter : Here you can select how many times per second the autosplitter checks for updates in the memory of the game. If you are experiencing performance issues, select a lower value, but keep in mind that a really low valeur will make the autosplitter less accurate.

This autosplitter has a built in load time remover, for it to work right click on your liveSplit window, select "Compare Against", then select "game time"

4. Extra : Some extra features I will add over the time (not usefull for speedrun).
