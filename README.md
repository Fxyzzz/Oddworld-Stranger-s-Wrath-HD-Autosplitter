Where to find the autosplitter?
	- The autosplitter is found directly in LiveSplit in the "Edit Splits" tab.

There are three settings you can set:

1. Splits: You can select each autosplits you want to have in your run. There is also the possiblity to specify if you are running individual levels (should be on only if running individual levels).

2. Extra : Some extra features I will add over the time (not usefull for speedrun).
   
3. Refresh rate of the autosplitter : Here you can select how many times per second the autosplitter checks for updates in the memory of the game. If you are experiencing performance issues, select a lower value, but keep in mind that a really low valeur will make the autosplitter less accurate.

This autosplitter has a built in load time remover, for it to work right click on your liveSplit window, select "Compare Against", then select "game time"


Lastly, if you would like any new autosplits to be added in the autosplitter, you can ping me in the Stranger's Wrath Speedrunning discord server and I'll try to add it.
In case you are not already on this discord server, here's the invitation code: 8H7jAGUWjC
